###18/08/19-v0.3###
+ Removed unecessary val variable from getValAt(int x, int y)
+ Removed rogue textBox1. Not sure what this was meant to be used for
###17/08/19-v0.3###
+ Solid cells now become read-only after clicking on DEBUG button.
+ Fixed issue with getValAt(cell)
+ Moved the declarations and initialization around in Form1.Designer.cs; Declaration first, then the rest.
###01/06/19-v0.2###
+ Moved functional code from Form1.Designer.cs to Form1.cs
+ Added code to store indexes of 'solid' values
- Need to populate the rest of the cells with some pre-def values.
###31/05/19-v0.2###
+ Set all cells to 0 at init stage
- Need to populate an array with indexes where value is not 0 -> these are 'set' cells and should never be changed.
###26/05/19-v0.2###
+ simplified the init code; removed unecesary evals and ifs
###26/05/19-v0.1###
+ removed autogenerated code for separate text boxes
+ removed autogenerated code for separate panel layouts
+ fixed tabIndex for all textboxes
+ fixed layout issues of the panels
+ fixed cell orders
- Need to tidy-up the population code. I think its too complex at the moment and could be simplified with less loops and conditions

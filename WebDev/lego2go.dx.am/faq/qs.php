	<table> 
		<a id="1">A1: All sets cost &euro;10 for the first two days and &euro;3 for every day after that plus delivery and collection fee if applicable. These depend on your location.</a> </br>

		<a id="2">A2: A set can be kept for up to 28 days. Pre-pay is required for the intended days. If you wish to keep your set for additional days after your original booked time expires, you will need to 
					pay for extra days if you wish to retain your full deposit. Standard daily fee (&euro;3) will be deducated from your deposit if no payment is recieved. There is a grace period of two (2) hours.</a> </br>

		<a id="3">A3: Generally no penalty will be charged for most missing or broken pieces. However if it is a special piece (such as a remote controller / motor / battery pack / pneumatic pump / pipe) 
				or a large number of pieces (more than 5) an appropriate fine will be charged from the deposit depending on the market value of the piece(s).</a> </br>

		<a id="4">A4: The original instructions are included at an additional fee of &euro;10. This is a security deposit since the manuals can be easily damaged or lost. If no damage is caused to the
				 manuals when the set is returned, the full fee of &euro;10 is returned to you. A photocopy manual is available with a security deposit of &euro;1 per copy. A free digital PDF is provided with every set in the form of a URL 
				and a QR code on the box. The instructions are viewable on any device that supports PDF files.</a> </br>

		<a id="5">A5: All sets come in a plain cardboard box. Original box is available for an additional fee of &euro;5 to your original deposit. This is because these boxes can be damaged very easily.
				If no damaged is caused to the box when the set is returned, the full fee of &euro;5 is returned to you.</a> </br>

		<a id="6">A6: No re-packaging is required but some disassembly may be recommended for ease of transport. We'll do all the work after a set is returned.</a> </br>

		<a id="7">A7: If a set that you want to rent is currently not available or you want to make sure you get the set when you want - you can make a booking at the order page. There is no cancellation fee
			for up to 24 hours before your order is due.</a> </br>

		<a id="8">A8: The fun does not have to end! If you wish to keep the set for longer and you did not have it for 28 days already and the set is not booked by another customer, simply pay the daily fee (&euro;3) for the desired number 
				of days and keep on playing! </a> </br>

		<a id="9">A9: Yes. The price is negotiable and discount is given to loyal customer.</a> </br>

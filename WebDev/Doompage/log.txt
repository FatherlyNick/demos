	<<--List of known issues-->>

	* Favicon not working in Internet Explorer
	[Suggested fix: ]

	* The contents in the 'contents' div are not perfectly centered
	[Suggested fix: ]

	* Resizing of the page results in unproportionality of the contents
	[Suggested fix: change the padding to be in '%' instead of 'px']
	//=======================================================================================================================================
	*The header does not show which page you are currently on
	[Suggested fix: using php name tags for different pages and letting the CSS generate on the fly depending on which page its currently on ]
	========================================================================================================================================//
	* Selected CSS are not set when switching to a different page.
	[Suffested fix: Use a cookie to keep track of the current CSS set.]

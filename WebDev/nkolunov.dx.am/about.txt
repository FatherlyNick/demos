This directory is dedicated to a personal site I developed between 2014 and 2017. It was meant to be a portfolio of sorts but instead
became a JavaScript calendar app where users could add events and a public dictionary where users could add words and their definitions
along with sounds and pictures of the word. Editing was allowed. I wanted users to be able to modify their own words they added - for this
I created a simple password system that authenticated a user (to make sure it was the original poster of the word) and then allowed
modifications if the password matched up with the word added.


How to use: 
1) download the whole directory as nkolunov.dx.am;
2) Put this dorectory on your server (you need a webserver to run all of the php)
3) Run dbstuff/1803541_db STRUCTURE.sql script on your mySQL db and it will set up the db as you need
  optionally, run dbstuff/1803541_db DATA.sql to populate the db with some data
4) Each directory has an about file to explain what its doing. Read these if you wish to find out what the directory is about

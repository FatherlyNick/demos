- Known issues button added to every footer and aligned to the right borrom corner.
#####ver-03/07/17##### v0.9.0.2
+ Added the Feedback button to the header. Now every page has a feedback function, which makes sense.

- Implemment the back end code for the DB as needed.
#####ver-28/06/17##### v0.9
+ Changed the cal URL data separators from '?' to '&'. It just makes more sense here.
